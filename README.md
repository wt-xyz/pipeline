This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About
This is the WT Consulting template repo to get started quickly using our usual front end stack. 

At a top level we use React, NextJs and Typescript. <br> <br>
We also use: <br> 
eslint for linting. <br>
prettier for formatting. <br>
Husky for commit rules and pre-commit linting and formatting. <br>
Storybook for rapid prototyping and some testing.  <br>
Mantine for themeing and for Components library when it is faster than using component. <br>
Yarn V4 for package management.

When using this repository, do not make commits to it directly. This is a template which means that we use this as a starting ground to start new repositories. Considder downloading it as a zip and adding it to a new repository. 

## Getting Started
First, run a yarn install: 

```bash
yarn install
```
Then, run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
